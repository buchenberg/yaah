# Project Instructions for AI Agents

This project keeps a single canonical instruction file for AI coding
assistants: [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md). Read that first — it contains the repo
layout, build and test commands, style conventions, and the engine-view
architecture notes.

CLAUDE.md exists only so tools that auto-load `CLAUDE.md` find their way to
AGENTS.md.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/core-concepts/sync-concepts.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.

## Dolt Server — Operational Awareness (All Agents)

Dolt is the data plane for beads (issues, mail, identity, work history). It runs
as a single server on port 3307 serving all databases. **It is fragile.**

### If you detect Dolt trouble

Symptoms: `bd` commands hang/timeout, "connection refused", "database not found",
query latency > 5s, unexpected empty results.

**BEFORE restarting Dolt, collect diagnostics.** Dolt hangs are hard to
reproduce. A blind restart destroys the evidence. Always:

```bash
# 1. Capture goroutine dump (safe — does not kill the process)
kill -QUIT $(cat ~/gt/.dolt-data/dolt.pid)  # Dumps stacks to Dolt's stderr log

# 2. Capture server status while it's still (mis)behaving
gt dolt status 2>&1 | tee /tmp/dolt-hang-$(date +%s).log

# 3. THEN escalate with the evidence
gt escalate -s HIGH "Dolt: <describe symptom>"
```

**Do NOT just `gt dolt stop && gt dolt start` without steps 1-2.**

**Escalation path** (any agent can do this):
```bash
gt escalate -s HIGH "Dolt: <describe symptom>"     # Most failures
gt escalate -s CRITICAL "Dolt: server unreachable"  # Total outage
```

The Mayor receives all escalations. Critical ones also notify the Overseer.

### If you see test pollution

Orphan databases (testdb_*, beads_t*, beads_pt*, doctest_*) accumulate on the
production server and degrade performance. This is a recurring problem.

```bash
gt dolt status              # Check server health + orphan count
gt dolt cleanup             # Remove orphan databases (safe — protects production DBs)
```

**NEVER use `rm -rf` on `~/.dolt-data/` directories.** Use `gt dolt cleanup` instead.

### Key commands
```bash
gt dolt status              # Server health, latency, orphan count
gt dolt start / stop        # Manage server lifecycle
gt dolt cleanup             # Remove orphan test databases
```

### Communication hygiene

Every `gt mail send` creates a permanent bead + Dolt commit. Every `gt nudge`
creates nothing. **Default to nudge for routine agent-to-agent communication.**

Only use mail when the message MUST survive the recipient's session death
(handoffs, structured protocol messages, escalations). See `mail-protocol.md`.
